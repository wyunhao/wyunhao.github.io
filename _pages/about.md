I am a MSCS student at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tal Malkin](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/) and co-advised Prof. [Eran Tromer](https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/). During my master's studey, I also, with my great pleasure, worked with Prof. [Lior Horesh](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-lhoresh) on quantum computing.

My research interest lies on cryptography, especially lattice based encryption and secure multi-party computation, and quantum computing such as entanglement and complexity classes. My recent research focuses on [Oblivious Message Retrieval](https://github.com/ObliviousMessageRetrieval) together with [Zeyu Liu](https://zeyuthomasliu.github.io/).

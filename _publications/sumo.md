Electric vehicles (EVs) have been used in the ride-hailing system in recent years, which brings the electric fleet management problem (EFMP) critical. This paper aims to leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in EFMP. In particular, we focus on how EVs learn to manage battery charging, pick up and drop off passengers. We propose an integrated SUMO-Gym framework based on the SUMO simulator to capture EVsâ€™ asynchronous decision-making regarding charging and ride-hailing in complex traffic environments. We adopt a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) scheme, where each EV decides to get charged or pick up a passenger on the upper level and chooses a charging station or passenger on the lower level. We develop a learning algorithm for the HRL scheme to solve EFMP and present numerical results about the efficiency of our algorithm and policies EVs have learned in EFMP. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LovelyBuggies/SUMO-Gym, which provides an open-source environment for researchers to design traffic scenarios and test RL algorithms for EFMP.

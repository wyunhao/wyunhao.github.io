collection: publications
# permalink: /publication/gomr
excerpt: 'This paper is a is to leverage a third-party server to scan through the bullet board on behalf of recipients and retrieve the pertinent messages without knowing who is asking for the messages or which messages it sends back. We further consider the scenario when senders want to address a single message to a group of recipients either pre-formed or chosen on-flight by senders.'
